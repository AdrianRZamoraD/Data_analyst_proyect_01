This will be a lot more complicated than the orders. Mainly because we need to calculate how much
inventory we're using and then identify inventory taht needs reordering.
We also want to calculate how much each pizza costs to make based on the cost of the ingredients
so we can keep an eye on pricing and P/L.
Here is what we need:

1. Total quantity by ingredient (No. of order x ingredient quantity in recipe)
2. Total cost of ingredients
3. Calculated cost of the pizza
4. precentage stock remaining by ingredient

use Proyect_01
go

SELECT
	o.item_id,
	i.sku,
	i.item_name,
	r.ing_id,
	r.quanty AS recipe_quantity,
	sum(o.quanty) as order_quantity
FROM 
	orders o
	left join item i ON o.item_id = i.item_id
	LEFT JOIN recipe r ON i.sku = r.recipe_id
GROUp BY 
	o.item_id, 
	i.sku, 
	i.item_name,
	r.ing_id,
	r.quanty
